# TODO list app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About project

The todo list project was created for users who often forget about their daily duties or forget about important events in their lives.

## Technology used in the application

React, TypeScript, Styled components

## App description

I wrote the whole application using React and TypeScript languages which are based on JavaScript.
To style my website I used the Styled Components library.
In the header section, I included information about today's date and a photo of the calendar.
In the next section, we are asked to enter a task.
Then, using the button, add the entered task to the list below.
Using the list, we can edit our previous tasks, delete them and mark whether they have already been completed.

## How to start App

At first you need to pull lastest branch from our GitHub repository to your local Git by git pull

Next step is to open files in Visual Studio Code
